     Rideshare is a carpooling web application designed to match people who need rides with those who can give them. When you log in, you can set preferences such as "Match me only with other women" or "Match me only with people near my age." Rideshare's automatic optimizing program was specifically designed with matching the maximum number of people, while still keeping their routes close to the original route specified. You can view your route request with Google Maps right here from Rideshare, and view the profiles of people matched to you.*<br />

     *Note: Rideshare is not responsible for your personal safety. By creating an account, you agree to use common sense when carpooling and not to sue Rideshare for anything that could happen to you as a result of carpooling with someone you met through Rideshare. Rideshare is not available to people under the age of 18.
